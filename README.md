# RustShop (meta)

`rustshop` is an attempt at building a template for developers
to help them start their own cloud-based system, without much Ops experience.

The basic technologies used are:

* Rust (for all tools, and eventually example applications)
* Nix (for all things build & dev-env & glue)
* AWS (for cloud hosting)
* Terraform (for infrastructure automation)

See [Tech Stack README](./README.techstack.md) for more details.

Even though the aim is to be heavily Rust-oriented, RustShop should be
helpful for setting up cloud-based applications using other programming
languages.

For fun and to have real-like general direction, RustShop pretends to be a real (fake)
bussiness, trying to bring a startup collaboration realities.
