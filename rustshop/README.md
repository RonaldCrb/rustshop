# `rustshop` binaries

RustShop (the fake company) have built bunch of generic automation
to help developers work effectively.

These binaries are all in the current directory (that consist of
a separate Nix flake), and it is completely standalone and reusable.


Any "software shop" (organization) - new or existing can potentially
find them useful. You are also welcome to submit patches and new
functionality (including new tools)

You can find the list of [`rustshop` packages in this Cargo workspace's `./Cargo.toml`](./Cargo.toml).
